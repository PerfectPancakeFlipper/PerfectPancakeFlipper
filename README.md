- 📫 How to reach me: smoke signal long, short, short, long, short, short, long, long, long . . . within sight of the northern spine of the green mounntains.
- 😄 Pronouns: a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere.
- ⚡ Fun fact: the world’s largest pancake was made in 1994 in Rochdale, England. It measured 49 feet 3 inches in diameter.
